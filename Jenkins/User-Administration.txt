# 👥 Jenkins User Administration 

---

## 📌 What is User Administration?

User administration means:

* Creating users
* Giving permissions
* Restricting access based on job role

👉 Not everyone should have **admin access**.

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

🏢 **Office Building**

* Admin → full access
* Developer → development rooms
* Tester → testing rooms

Everyone does **only their job**.

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step User Administration

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Open User Management

1️⃣ Go to **Manage Jenkins**
2️⃣ Click **Security**
3️⃣ Click **Manage Users**

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Create Users

Create two users:

* **ravi** → Developer
* **rani** → Tester

👉 By default, **new users get all permissions** (not safe)

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Why Do We Restrict Permissions?

❌ Developer should not change Jenkins settings
❌ Tester should not delete pipelines

✔ Everyone should have access **only as needed**

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Install Role-Based Authorization Plugin

1️⃣ Go to **Manage Jenkins**
2️⃣ Click **Manage Plugins**
3️⃣ Search for:

```
Role-Based Authorization Strategy
```

4️⃣ Click **Install without restart**

🧠 Analogy
🧰 Installing lock system for office doors

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Enable Role-Based Security

1️⃣ Go to **Manage Jenkins**
2️⃣ Click **Configure Global Security**
3️⃣ Under **Authorization**

* Select **Role-Based Strategy**
  4️⃣ Click **Apply** and **Save**

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Manage Roles

1️⃣ Go to **Manage Jenkins**
2️⃣ Click **Manage and Assign Roles**
3️⃣ Click **Manage Roles**

---

## 🔹 Step 7: Create Global Role

### Role Name:

```
employee
```

✔ Select basic permissions (read, job view, etc.)
✔ Click **Apply** and **Save**

🧠 Analogy
🆔 Office entry card for all employees

---

## 🔹 Step 8: Create Item Roles (Project Level)

---

### 🔸 Developer Role

* Role name: `developer`
* Pattern:

```
Dev.*
```

✔ Permissions related to build, configure jobs
✔ Apply & Save

---

### 🔸 Tester Role

* Role name: `tester`
* Pattern:

```
test.*
```

✔ Permissions related to read, run tests
✔ Apply & Save

🧠 Analogy
🏗 Developer works on Dev projects
🧪 Tester works on Test projects

---

## 🔹 Step 9: Assign Roles to Users

1️⃣ Go to **Manage and Assign Roles**
2️⃣ Click **Assign Roles**

---

### 🔸 Global Role Assignment

* Add users:

  * ravi
  * rani
* Assign **employee** role

---

### 🔸 Item Role Assignment

* Add:

  * ravi → developer role
  * rani → tester role

✔ Save changes

---

## 🎯 Final Permission Setup

| User | Global Role | Item Role |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- |
| ravi | employee    | developer |
| rani | employee    | tester    |

---

## ✅ Final Result

✔ Ravi can work only on **Dev jobs**
✔ Rani can work only on **Test jobs**
✔ No one has unnecessary admin access
✔ Jenkins is secure

---

## ✅ One-Line Summary

**Jenkins user administration means creating users and giving permissions based on their job role, just like giving office access only to the required rooms.** 🔐🏢
