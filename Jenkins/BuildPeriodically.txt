# ⏰ Jenkins – Build Periodically 

---

## 🔰 What is **Build Periodically** in Jenkins?

### 📌 Simple Meaning

**Build periodically** means Jenkins will **run your job automatically at a fixed time**, even if no new code is pushed.

You tell Jenkins **WHEN to run**, and Jenkins follows that schedule.

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

⏰ **Alarm Clock**

* You set alarm for **6:00 AM**
* Every day at 6:00, alarm rings
* You don’t press anything

👉 Same way:

* You set time in Jenkins
* Jenkins runs the job automatically

---

## 🔰 Where is this used?

You see **Build periodically** inside:

```
Job → Configure → Build Triggers → Build periodically
```

---

## 🔰 Cron Format (Very Simple)

Jenkins uses **cron syntax** to define time.

### 📌 Format

```
MINUTE   HOUR   DAY-OF-MONTH   MONTH   DAY-OF-WEEK
```

Or simply:

```
MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW
```
