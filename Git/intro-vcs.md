# 🟦 Version Controlling (Simple Explanation)

* Version Control is the **process of maintaining multiple versions of the code**.
* All team members **upload (check-in)** their code into a central server called a **VCS**.
* The VCS automatically **integrates everyone’s work**, so when someone downloads, they see the **full team’s code**.
* It also keeps **old versions**, so we can switch to any version anytime.
* VCS also tracks **who made what change**.

# 🟦 Types of Version Control Systems

## 1️⃣ **Centralized Version Control**

* Single **central server** stores all the code.
* Team members **check-in** and **check-out** from that one server.
* Version control happens **only in the remote server**.
* Examples: **SVN, CVS**

---

## 2️⃣ **Distributed Version Control**

* Every developer has a **local repository** on their own machine.
* Version control happens **locally first**, then code is pushed to remote.
* Both **local** and **remote** have full version history.
* Examples: **Git, Mercurial**

# Q: what is git
- Git is a version control system (VCS) — a tool that helps you track changes in your source code over time. It lets multiple developers collaborate on a project without overwriting each other’s work.
- Think of it like a “time machine” for your code — you can go back to any previous version whenever you need.

# 🔹 Why Git?

✅ Tracks every change made in the code
✅ Allows collaboration among team members
✅ Lets you revert to previous versions (undo mistakes easily)
✅ Works both online (with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) and offline (locally on your machine)
✅ Helps manage different branches of code for features, testing, and releases



# 🔹 How Git Works (in short)
- Repository (repo) — The project folder that Git tracks.
- Commit — A snapshot of your changes.
- Branch — A separate line of development.
- Merge — Combines changes from different branches.
- Remote — A version of your repository hosted online (e.g., on GitHub).
- Clone / Pull / Push — Commands to get or send code between local and remote repositories.
