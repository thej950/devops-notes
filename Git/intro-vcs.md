# 🟦 Version Controlling (Simple Explanation)

* Version Control is the **process of maintaining multiple versions of the code**.
* All team members **upload (check-in)** their code into a central server called a **VCS**.
* The VCS automatically **integrates everyone’s work**, so when someone downloads, they see the **full team’s code**.
* It also keeps **old versions**, so we can switch to any version anytime.
* VCS also tracks **who made what change**.

# 🟦 Types of Version Control Systems

## 1️⃣ **Centralized Version Control**

* Single **central server** stores all the code.
* Team members **check-in** and **check-out** from that one server.
* Version control happens **only in the remote server**.
* Examples: **SVN, CVS**

## 2️⃣ **Distributed Version Control**

* Every developer has a **local repository** on their own machine.
* Version control happens **locally first**, then code is pushed to remote.
* Both **local** and **remote** have full version history.
* Examples: **Git, Mercurial**
