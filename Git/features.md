## Git Features

🔹 **1. Distributed Version Control (DVCS)**
Every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including full history. Enables offline work, recovery if server fails, and high reliability.

🔹 **2. Branching and Merging**
Lightweight branches for features, bug fixes, experiments. Easy merging and deletion.

🔹 **3. Data Integrity (SHA-1 Hashing)**
Uses cryptographic SHA-1 hashing for all objects, ensuring tamper detection and reliability.

🔹 **4. Staging Area (Index)**
Intermediate area to review changes before committing.

🔹 **5. Fast and Lightweight**
Local operations make Git extremely fast—no network dependency.

🔹 **6. History and Tracking**
Tracks who changed what and when. Viewable via `git log`.

🔹 **7. Collaboration via Remotes**
Supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket for distributed teamwork.

🔹 **8. Security and Reliability**
Redundant local copies + hashing ensure strong reliability.

🔹 **9. Non-linear Development**
Parallel work via branches; supports workflows like Gitflow.

🔹 **10. Open Source and Free**
Global community support; works across all OS.

🔹 **11. Undo and Revert Capabilities**
Commands like `git reset`, `git revert`, `git checkout` allow safe rollback.

🔹 **12. Efficient Storage**
Uses snapshots and compression for optimized storage.
